/*A monitoring system generates a sequence of numeric event IDs from 1 to N. 
To make logs easier to analyse, the system applies tags to certain events based on predefined rules: 
• Events whose ID is divisible by 3 are tagged as “Buzz” 
• Events whose ID is divisible by 5 are tagged as “Fuzz” 
• Events divisible by both 3 and 5 receive both tags*/
